<h3> About me: </h3>
👋 Hi, I'm Meghana — a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo with a passion for turning ideas into impactful tech solutions.

With 2 years of hands-on programming experience, I thrive in collaborative environments where curiosity, creativity, and continuous learning drive innovation. I’m proficient in Python, C++, JavaScript, and SQL, and bring strong technical skills in front-end web development, Azure cloud computing, and cross-platform operating systems (macOS & Windows).

Through academic projects, personal initiatives, and coding workshops, I’ve built user-centric solutions that improve engagement and deliver real results. I enjoy diving into complex challenges, communicating technical concepts clearly, and constantly pushing the boundaries of what I can learn and create.

Let’s connect — I’m always excited to grow, build, and explore new opportunities in tech!
